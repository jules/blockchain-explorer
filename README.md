A simple Ethereum blockchain explorer. The search bar takes either a block number, transaction hash or address, and then opens a new page to display information about it.

##Set up

To set up, simply download/clone the repo, then:

```
npm install
npm start
```

The terminal will tell you the localhost and port the website is running on (most likely localhost:3000). Enter that into your browser to interact with the page.
